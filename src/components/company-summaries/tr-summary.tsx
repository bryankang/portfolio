      TrainerRoad provides training plans and workouts for cyclists. Think
      Peloton but targeted primarily to semi to professional athletes. Instead
      of a all-in-one bicycle, customers typically use a smart trainer which
      they can attach to their existing bicycles. The TrainerRoad apps
      communicate with the start trainer in order to provide a workout
      experience. I worked as a frontend developer and built features on the
      desktop app (Electron) and mobile app (React Native).
